Distributive Equity Evaluations of Transport Futures

This repository contains a reference guide and a series of Python notebooks to conduct quantitative analyses that can be used to understand the distributive equity impacts of public transit or other transportation infrastructure scenarios or projects. The foundational work contained within this notebook and the accompanying analysis code was developed by Drs. Jeff Allen and Steven Farber at the University of Toronto in 2021, but has been updated for new datasets and for use with Python.

To get started conducting your own analysis, download the PDF document entitled "Equity of Transport Futures Handbook" and follow the instructions contained therin.
